          Hello! I'm Jeffrey, a Software Engineer driven by a burning passion
          for growth and excellence. After graduating from San Jose State
          University with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering in Fall
          of 2020, my journey began at cybersecurity startup Bitglass, where I
          grew in a fast, impactful environment. Following Bitglass&apos;s
          acquisition by Forcepoint, I gained experience navigating the
          challenges and workflows of a larger organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strive to craft clean, efficient, and impactful web applications
          that solve real problems that I encounter while delivering the best
          user experiences possible. Outside of coding, I&apos;m often immersed
          in the world of custom mechanical keyboards, high-fidelity audio
          setups, or video games.
        </p>
        <p>
          After layoffs from my previous employer, I have taken a
          career break to refocus and re-evaluate my professional goals. Now I
          have returned with a newfound passion for the front-end field and AI.
          I&apos;m now actively exploring new opportunities where I can bring my
          skillset and growth mindset to contribute to solving real world
          problems.
