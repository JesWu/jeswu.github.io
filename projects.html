              I worked with a friend on this project, we both were involved in
              various E2E processes, creating several pages and RESTful APIs
              from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Takeaways:</strong><br />
              NextJS is a valuable library based on the face it can support both
              Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Client Side Rendering (CSR). It is
              also nice being able to use javascript in the entire stack.
              TypeScript is invaluable for the strict type checking it provides.
              Prisma was an ORM that was quite easy to use and MongoDB was also
              relatively straightforward for what the project itself required.

              This is currently the site you are on. This project was created to
              provide a platform to showcase any future projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tech Details:</strong><br />
              This project is aimed on focusing on refining the fundamentals,
              involving understanding and writing basic boilerplate from
              scratch. The site itself is built purely off of HTML and CSS.
              Seeing as there is minimal user interactivity and the site itself
              is not very complex, other complex libraries and frameworks were
              not necessary. SVG Icons were taken from Lucide.

            <p>
              <strong>Takeaways:</strong><br />
              Reviewing several HTML and CSS fundamentals was incredibly useful.
              It was an eye opener how far HTML and CSS can take you without
              involving Javascript.

              <strong>Description:</strong><br />
              Forcepoint Hackathon involving AI, where my team worked on an AI
              chat bot to help users work through Forcepoint ONE's most complex
              page - the Policy Page.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tech Details:</strong><br />
              A project involving AWS bedrock and LLama, configured to take in a
              user's structured prompt and generate a policy that aligns with
              what the user wants.

              One of the members of my hackathon team, I mainly worked on the
              chat overlay as well as helping engineer the prompt that users
              would enter in order to generate a policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Takeaways:</strong><br />
              I was able to experience deploying on AWS for the first time, as
              well as interact with a LLM more deeply other than basic github
              copilot use at work. Though hackathons are stressful due to their
              very short deadlines, it is extremely rewarding once you get your
              POC working and allows you to see the potential in the product if
              more time was allocated. This influenced Forcepoint's future
              annual roadmap, with our hackathon project being added to it.

              <strong>Tech Details:</strong><br />
              A complicated project that involved coordination from my team as
              well as Forcepoint's overseas DLP team. The solution was very
              specific and worked only under the conditions that we currently
              operated; The idea was to have a text file that contained the
              Forcepoint DLP pattern identifiers and descriptions. Utilizing
              this text file we could populate the front-end and send out a
              request to Forcepoint's DLP engine utilizing the specificied ID to
              process data. This was smart as it reduced cost because it did not
              require us to poll their endpoint to retrieve their patterns. This
              only worked because Forcepoint's DLP patterns very rarely changed,
              thus allowing us to very rarely update the text file.

              up meetings between members of the Forcepoint DLP team and me. Had
              to work on a solution on how to fetch and utilize Forcepoint's
              special DLP patterns.

              Never underestimate simple tasks, as it may involve code written
              by people no longer with the company and parts of the codebase you
              touch may be extremely old.

              This was a deceptively complex project at work, where I updated
              our frontend with a new rich text editor (quilljs). This was a lot
              more involved as it required me to also update our endpoints to
              comply with standards to keep any stored code safe through
              sanitization, which disallowed any dangerous HTML which would run
              unsafe code, such as the &lt;script/&gt; tag. This involved a lot
              of changes across the back-end and front-end from me, which I
              believe was a good experience learning parts of our application
              that were not part of my specialty, allowing me to become a more
              versatile engineer.

              This was my first major project at work, where I worked on
              updating a complex, legacy jQuery page to React. I was not
              comfortable with jQuery, having never really used it before and
              getting up to speed to release this project in a timely manner was
              challenging.

              <strong>Contributions:</strong><br />
              Worked with mentors to tackle the complex challenge of maintaining
              existing functionality on the page while allowing for easy
              extension for any projects in the future. Completed the work
              mainly by myself but mentor guidance was provided along the way.

            <p>
              <strong>Takeaways:</strong><br />
              Collaboration is key to success. Learning a new technology is not
              trivial. I was able to reduce the time to interactive metric by 5
              seconds down to 2, greatly improving the end user experience.
