            I worked with a friend on this project, we both were involved in
            various E2E processes, creating several pages and RESTful APIs from
            scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Takeaways:</strong><br />
            NextJS is a valuable library based on the face it can support both
            Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Client Side Rendering (CSR). It is
            also nice being able to use javascript in the entire stack.
            TypeScript is invaluable for the strict type checking it provides.
            Prisma was an ORM that was quite easy to use and MongoDB was also
            relatively straightforward for what the project itself required.

          <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Description:</strong><br />
            This is currently the site you are on. This project was created to
            provide a platform to showcase any future projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tech Details:</strong><br />
            This project is aimed on focusing on refining the fundamentals,
            involving understanding and writing basic boilerplate from scratch.
            The site itself is built purely off of HTML and CSS. Seeing as there
            is minimal user interactivity and the site itself is not very
            complex, other complex libraries and frameworks were not necessary.
            SVG Icons were taken from Lucide.

            This is a project that I have completed from scratch by myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Takeaways:</strong><br />
            Reviewing several HTML and CSS fundamentals was incredibly useful.
            It was an eye opener how far HTML and CSS can take you without
            involving Javascript.
